    "#### What is Standard Deviation? \n",
    "Standard deviation is the measure of how spread out the numbers in the data are. It is the square root of variance, where variance is the average of squared differences from the mean.[1]\n",

    "Excel has two functions to calculate statndard deviation..[2]\n",

    "Estimates standard deviation based on a sample.[3]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### STDEV.P\n",
    "Calculates standard deviation based on the entire population given as arguments.[4]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### STDEV.P vs STDEV.S \n",
    "So, what are the difference in STDEV.P and STDEV.S function? Letâ€™s Explore.[5]\n",

    "In STDEV.P function, the squared deviation is divided by the total number of arguments, mostly represented as N.\n",

    "The numpy module of Python provides a function called numpy.std(), used to compute the standard deviation along the specified axis. This function returns the standard deviation of the array elements. The square root of the average square deviation (computed from the mean), is known as the standard deviation. By default, the standard deviation is calculated for the flattened array. With the help of the x.sum()/N, the average square deviation is normally calculated, and here, N=len(x).[6]\n",

    "\n",
    "This parameter defines the alternative output array in which the result is to be placed. This alternative ndarray has the same shape as the expected output. But we cast the type when necessary.\n",

    "#### ddof : int(optional)\n",

    "This parameter defines the Delta Degrees of Freedom. The N-ddof divisor is used in calculations, where N is the number of elements. By default, the value of this parameter is set to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### keepdims : bool(optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is optional, whose value, when true, will leave the reduced axis as dimensions with size one in the resultant. When it passes the default value, it will allow the non-default values to pass via the mean method of sub-classes of ndarray, but the keepdims will not pass. Also, the output or the result will broadcast against the input array correctly.\n",
