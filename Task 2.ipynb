    "The Chi-squared test for independence is a statistical hypothesis test like a t-test. It is used to analyse whether two categorical variables are independent.The Wikipedia article on the test for independance gives the table below as an example, stating the Chi-squared value based on it is approximately 24.6. The objective is to use scipy.stats and leverage the Chi-squared test for independence, to verify the given stastical values and calculate the associated p value. \n",
